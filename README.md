Poetic Texts Generator
Overview
The Poetic Texts Generator is a machine learning-based project designed to create original and engaging poetic compositions. Using advanced natural language processing techniques and deep learning models, the project generates texts that mimic the style, structure, and creativity of poetry.

Features
Generates original poetic texts based on training data.
Customizable to different poetic styles and themes.
Supports fine-tuning with user-provided datasets.
Interactive interface for generating and exploring poetic compositions.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8 or later
TensorFlow/Keras
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running and experimenting with the provided .ipynb files)
Other dependencies listed in requirements.txt (if included)
Installation
Clone the repository or download the project files.
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place the textgenerator.keras model file in the project directory.
Usage
Open the main.ipynb notebook in Jupyter:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
Run the notebook cells to load the model, preprocess data, and generate poetry.
(Optional) Customize the input seed text in the notebook for personalized outputs.
Files
main.ipynb: The primary notebook for running the text generation process.
main-checkpoint.ipynb: A backup of the main notebook with checkpoints.
textgenerator.keras: The pre-trained model file used for generating poetic texts.
Training and Fine-Tuning
To train the model on a new dataset:

Prepare your dataset of poetry or text in plain text format.
Modify the training section of the notebook to load your dataset.
Train the model and save the updated weights.
